    `An object is said to be in motion if its position changes with time. The position of the
object can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin. For motion in
a straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as
negative. The average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average
velocity over a given time interval.`,
`Instantaneous velocity or simply velocity is defined as the limit of the average velocity
as the time interval âˆ†t becomes infinitesimally small : ${equation.instantaneous_velocity} The velocity at a particular instant is equal to the slope of the tangent drawn on
position-time graph at that instant.`
